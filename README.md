# Inferring Personality Type from social media posts
A machine learning project where the main objective was to develop a method to infer one's personality type

         * Sk-learn -----> Developing the Logistic Regression classifier
         * NLTK ---> Pre-processing of data
         * Gensim -> Library for word embedding
         * Pandas ---> Loading data as a pandas dataframe
This is a univerity project done by students from the Vrije Universiteit :

         * Varun Behari
         * Lorenzo Baracco
         * Agostino Sorbo
         * Altan Michelagnoli
         * Illia Vasko
## A scientific paper has been written to clarify all of the decisions decisions made:
The paper presents the performance of state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) classification models,
such as K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Logistic Regression, 
on an extended personality Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) Kaggle dataset. 
Each instance in the dataset consists of a Reddit user's post from the r/mbti subreddit with the labeled personality type. 
The paper investigates into the possibility of using the Doc2Vec word embedding technology to guess an individual's personality type based on their social media posts. By comparing different classification methods, 
the accuracy of the model is evaluated. 
It is concluded that it is indeed possible to use word embedding to classify the personality type of an individual based on their social media posts.
